Big Mart Sales - predict the product sales with regression - Data_Preprocessing
The predictive model was created using the python Statistcal Language and Populating the interactive namespace from numpy and matplotlib
This sections I am giving the Insights that I think could help understand the data better. 
Item Outlet Sales vs Item MRP:
It can be seen in graph we can see that in sales Supermarket Type 1 dominates compared to other type of outlets. However, it is interesting to see the gaps in the prices around 60,130 and 200. There could be many reason for why there are gaps in the prices, it could be because prices for different categories differ and which led to the gaps.
Item Visibility vs Item Outlet Sales
Our observations in the previous do not hold when we see at the sales of Items in different outlets. Here the grocery store does have a uniform distribution even for items which have higher visibility. Even for Supermarket Type 3 some of Items with high sales have lower visibility compared to other items.
